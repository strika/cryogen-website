I was teaching an introduction to software engineering and design patterns. Students were just a couple of years younger than me.</p><p class="paragraph">One day I said to a class that John McCarthy died yesterday. One of students asked "Who?" and soon I realized that no one in the room new who John McCarthy is <a href="#1">[1]</a>. That made me sad. Shouldn't they know?</p><p class="paragraph">John McCarthy was computer scientist that developed Lisp programming language <a href="#2">[2]</a>, godfather of artificial intelligence and AI researcher. For his contributions to computer science he received many honors, including Turing Award and Kyoto Prize.</p><p class="paragraph">It seams there is a shortage of computer science history classes on universities. And shortage of curiosity for the field history among students and practitioners, as well.</p><p><span id="1">[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29">John McCarthy on Wikipedia</a></span><br><span id="2">[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lisp on Wikipedia</a></span></p></div></article></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 content comment"><p>Do you have a comment?
