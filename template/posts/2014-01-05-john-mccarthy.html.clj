; @title Who is John McCarthy?

(p "Few years ago I was a teaching assistant on University of Novi Sad. I was teaching an introduction to software engineering and design patterns. Students were just a couple of years younger than me.")

(p "One day I said to a class that John McCarthy died yesterday. One of students asked \"Who?\" and soon I realized that no one in the room new who John McCarthy is " (link "[1]" "#1") ". That made me sad. Shouldn't they know?")

(p "John McCarthy was computer scientist that developed Lisp programming language " (link "[2]" "#2")", godfather of artificial intelligence and AI researcher. For his contributions to computer science he received many honors, including Turing Award and Kyoto Prize.")

(p "It seams there is a shortage of computer science history classes on universities. And shortage of curiosity for the field history among students and practitioners, as well.")
