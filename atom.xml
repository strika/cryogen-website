   draggable and droppable interactions. And I just couldn't make the scenario
   pass. But I also couldn't stop working on it. One of reasons was that there was very
   similar scenario already passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Scenarios were using Capybara's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Element:drag_to&quot;&gt;#drag_to&lt;/a&gt; method that makes testing drag and drop a breeze.
   After couple of hours of debugging and moving stuff around, I saw something
   interesting in the Firefox window that runs the test - during the drag and drop
   execution scroll bar moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The thing is that Firefox window was small. After drag started, small scrolling happened 
   to reveal the drop target. To make the scenario pass I had to make both the drag node and
   the drop node visible from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Final solution was to maximize Firefox window just before drag is initiated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;# in a step definition
page.driver.browser.manage.window.maximize&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Sometimes it pays off to follow how a test is executed in a browser window.
   And for some tests you really need to start &quot;thinking&quot; like a machine to
   understand what's going on inside a test.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link>http://nebojsa.stricevic.info/2013/12/hello-world.html</link><updated>2013-12-13T00:00:00</updated><id>http://nebojsa.stricevic.info/2013/12/hello-world.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Lauching the site...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;3... 2... 1...&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
