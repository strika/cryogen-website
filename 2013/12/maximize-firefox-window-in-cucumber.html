   draggable and droppable interactions. And I just couldn't make the scenario
   pass. But I also couldn't stop working on it. One of reasons was that there was very
   similar scenario already passing.</p><p class="paragraph">Scenarios were using Capybara's <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Element:drag_to">#drag_to</a> method that makes testing drag and drop a breeze.
   After couple of hours of debugging and moving stuff around, I saw something
   interesting in the Firefox window that runs the test - during the drag and drop
   execution scroll bar moves.</p><p class="paragraph">The thing is that Firefox window was small. After drag started, small scrolling happened 
   to reveal the drop target. To make the scenario pass I had to make both the drag node and
   the drop node visible from the start.</p><p class="paragraph">Final solution was to maximize Firefox window just before drag is initiated:</p><pre class="prettyprint"># in a step definition
page.driver.browser.manage.window.maximize</pre><br><p class="paragraph">Sometimes it pays off to follow how a test is executed in a browser window.
   And for some tests you really need to start "thinking" like a machine to
   understand what's going on inside a test.</p></div></article></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 content comment"><p>Do you have a comment?
