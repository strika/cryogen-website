  <p>This was my first week as an independent consultant. And it went pretty slow. A project that I planned for this week got postponed, so I concentrated on some preparation work.</p><p>I updated my homepage a little bit. The website needs a full redesign, but for now, my goal was to make it decent. I updated the text on the homepage, added some links to the articles I wrote and the link to the <a href='http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016&#95;stricevic&#95;supercharged&#95;feature&#95;flags/'>conference talk</a> I recently gave at WebCamp.si. I also started writing a short summary of my professional life, to replace the CV.</p><p>Another thing that I set up is this log of my weekly activities.</p><p>I did some research about Toptal as a source of clients. To get into Toptal, you need to pass a interview process, much like a standard company interview. One of the tasks is <a href='https://codility.com/'>Codility</a> test. I tried doing few Codility tests that are <a href='https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/'>freely available</a> and they are harder than I though. So I set up a <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>git repository</a> and started going through the lessons.</p><p>My goal is to complete as many lessons as I can. I learned few things so far:</p><ul><li>Lessons are harder than I thought. I'm not as good as I though.</li><li>I can get better by practicing. Ideas can be applied in different  challenges.</li><li>You need to know what <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big&#95;O&#95;notation'>Big O notation</a> is.</li><li>Every task in Codility has expectations for performance expressed in Bit O  notation. This is also a hint and a guide how you need to implement the solution.</li><li>It's good to write code that generates test data and to use benchmarking to  make sure a solution has good performance.</li><li>It's useful to develop a naive or slow solution first (if you can do that  fast), as you can use it to test the fast solution, that often has more  complex implementation.</li><li>My solutions to more complex problems are not that readable and the code is  not great.</li></ul><p>I plan to continue working on Codility challenges.</p><p>I also migrated email sending for a side project that I have (<a href='http://servisne.info'>servisne.info</a>) from Mandrill to Mailgun.</p>
