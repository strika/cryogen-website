    <h1>Papers I read</h1>
  </div>

  
  <h4><a name="organizing&#95;programs&#95;without&#95;classes"></a>Organizing Programs Without Classes</h4><p>This paper is written by a group of authors from Stanford. It was published in 1991.</p><p>It speaks about object oriented languages that are not class based. Instead, they use prototypes and traits to implement extensions, encapsulation and dynamic inheritance. The paper compares class based and classless languages and their expressive power.</p><p>The paper is using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>Self</a> as an example, but many concepts can be applied to the most popular prototype based programming language today - JavaScript.</p><h4><a name="searching&#95;for&#95;spaceships&#95;by&#95;david&#95;eppstein"></a>Searching for Spaceships by David Eppstein</h4><p>This paper is different than others on the list. While most other papers would be interesting to any programmer, this one is reserved for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The&#95;Game&#95;of&#95;Life'>Game of Life</a> enthusiasts. It explains the rich Life vocabulary and presents different species of Life. Then it compares different techniques for searching for spaceships and presents a new technique developed by the author.</p><p>If you are into Life and dream about finding spaceships and implementing your own search program, this is a great paper for you. It's dense, so I have to read it few more times. The paper was published in 2000, so I assume that finding the list of papers that cite <em>Searching for Spaceships</em> will produce an interesting reading material.</p><h4><a name="computer&#95;programming&#95;as&#95;an&#95;art&#95;by&#95;donald&#95;e.&#95;knuth"></a>Computer Programming as an Art by Donald E. Knuth</h4><p>Computer Programming as an Art is the ACM Turing Award Lecture by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald&#95;Knuth'>Donald Knuth</a> from 1974. Knuth is famous by his multi-volume work <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The&#95;Art&#95;of&#95;Computer&#95;Programming'>The Art of Computer Programming</a>, sometimes abbreviated as TAOCP.</p><p>In his lecture, Knuth explains why he chose to call programming an art. He's not calling the whole programming "universe" an art. Instead, he explains that some parts of programming profession are an art, while some are science or a craft.</p><p>I remember that few years ago blog posts and conference talks about programming as art/craft/engineering/science were appearing everywhere. Knuth's lecture is the earliest and probably the most important discussion on the topic as it inspired many others.</p><p>This is another paper I expect to keep returning over the years.</p><h4><a name="why&#95;functional&#95;programming&#95;matters&#95;by&#95;john&#95;hughes"></a>Why Functional Programming Matters by John Hughes</h4><p>The paper was originally published in 1984. It discusses advantages of functional programming over "conventional" languages. In particular, it discusses how higher order functions and lazy evaluation contribute to modularity.</p><p>I found useful that the paper clearly expresses how 2 major ideas from functional programming contribute to the overall functional programming style.</p><h4><a name="the&#95;humble&#95;programmer&#95;by&#95;edsger&#95;w.&#95;dijkstra"></a>The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra</h4><p>The Humble Programmer is the ACM Turing award Lecture by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger&#95;W.&#95;Dijkstra'>Dijkstra</a> from 1972. And it's a fantastic paper!</p><p>Dijkstra entered the programming profession in 1952. He talks about his experience as the first Dutch programmer and one of the pioneers of the discipline. He also speaks about problems and misconceptions that come from that period and some major milestones for the programming profession (like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic&#95;delay&#95;storage&#95;automatic&#95;calculator'>EDSAC</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran'>FORTRAN</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>LISP</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL&#95;60'>ALGOL 60</a>).</p><p>There are few popular quotes that come from the lecture. Just one of them is:</p><blockquote><p> If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with. </p></blockquote><p>And perhaps my favorite:</p><blockquote><p> The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. </p></blockquote><p>The paper if full of gems like these. I expect to keep returning to the paper for years.</p><h4><a name="some&#95;history&#95;of&#95;functional&#95;programming&#95;languages&#95;by&#95;d.&#95;a.&#95;turner."></a>Some History of Functional Programming Languages by D. A. Turner.</h4><p>It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>LISP</a>, was not influenced by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda&#95;calculus'>lambda calculus</a>. Apparently, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John&#95;McCarthy&#95;%28computer&#95;scientist%29'>John McCarthy</a> didn't study <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo&#95;Church'>Church's</a> papers, before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.</p><p>Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>Haskell</a>.</p><p><a href='https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf'>Download paper</a>.</p>
