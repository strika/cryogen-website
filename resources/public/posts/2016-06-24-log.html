  <h2>Log</h2>

  <p>This week I met some ex-coworkers. They told me they read this blog from time to time. While I appreciate that, I have to say that this blog is not really meant for reading. I don't think that a visitor can pick up a lot of useful stuff from reading it or that she can find amusement. However, I still think that it's important for me to keep writing regularly.</p><p>There are several reasons for that. My goal is to practice skills that I'm not good at but are very important for any software developer. One of those skills is writing. I'm not a native English speaker and I started writing somewhat recently, so every line of text that I write is important to improve my skills.</p><p>Not all writing is equal. I wrote several tutorials for <a href='http://semaphoreci.com/community/authors/strika'>Semaphore Community</a> that were well received. It's much better to write a piece that's useful for other developers than to write for myself. That is something that I need to work on more in future. However, since I do publish this web log, I still need to keep it at least decent, which is better than keeping it only for myself.</p><p>I think that moving to a more useful content from something that's not that useful is much easier than to do that from scratch. Time will tell if this is something that works for me.</p><p>Another thing that I'm practicing is keeping promises and staying on schedule. I want to publish few sentences every Friday. Sometimes it's not easy to find 15 minutes to do so, which makes keeping the promise even more important.</p><p>So, for now, I write this blog to improve my skills, but I hope I'll provide more value to visitors in future.</p>
