  <p>I started working on a client project. However, I still have one slot left. If you need my help, or if you know someone who might, let me know.</p><p>I bought a new laptop - Macbook Pro 13". My initial choice was Dell XPS 13" with Ubuntu. The main problem with Dell + Ubuntu is that some popular software (like Skype) doesn't work great. A friend advised me that this is something potential clients don't want to hear about.</p><p>I'm used to working on 27" iMac and didn't expect much from Macbook Pro. But, it's a really nice machine. It's good looking, faster than iMac and it has a great screen. My only criticism is that the keyboard is not that great. It has that clickety sound, like I have long finger nails. But, it's not a big problem.</p><p>I visited a local meetup that featured 2 talks. The first one was by Sandra Prvulović, an HR expert. It discussed the problem of finding experienced developers for a company. One of the most interesting remarks I heard is that the IT companies have more or less equal offer in Novi Sad. Because of that, not many developers switch companies, although many say that they would if a company makes a good offer.</p><p>The other talk was by <a href='https://medium.com/@tijanamomirov'>Tijana Momirov</a>. She talked about her experience living and working as a digital nomad. It was a very inspiring talk for someone who's just starting his own business.</p><p>I read the paper <a href='https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf'>Some History of Functional Programming Languages</a> by D. A. Turner. It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>LISP</a>, was not influenced by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda&#95;calculus'>lambda calculus</a>. Apparently, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John&#95;McCarthy&#95;%28computer&#95;scientist%29'>John McCarthy</a> didn't study <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo&#95;Church'>Church's</a> papers, before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.</p><p>Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>Haskell</a>.</p><p>My plan is to continue reading one <a href='/papers.html'>paper every week</a>.</p><p>I also continued working on <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>.</p>
