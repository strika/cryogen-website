&lt;p&gt;This was my first week as an independent consultant. And it went pretty slow. A project that I planned for this week got postponed, so I concentrated on some preparation work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I updated my homepage a little bit. The website needs a full redesign, but for now, my goal was to make it decent. I updated the text on the homepage, added some links to the articles I wrote and the link to the &lt;a href='http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016&amp;#95;stricevic&amp;#95;supercharged&amp;#95;feature&amp;#95;flags/'&gt;conference talk&lt;/a&gt; I recently gave at WebCamp.si. I also started writing a short summary of my professional life, to replace the CV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I set up is this log of my weekly activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did some research about Toptal as a source of clients. To get into Toptal, you need to pass a interview process, much like a standard company interview. One of the tasks is &lt;a href='https://codility.com/'&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt; test. I tried doing few Codility tests that are &lt;a href='https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/'&gt;freely available&lt;/a&gt; and they are harder than I though. So I set up a &lt;a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt; and started going through the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal is to complete as many lessons as I can. I learned few things so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lessons are harder than I thought. I'm not as good as I though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can get better by practicing. Ideas can be applied in different  challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to know what &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big&amp;#95;O&amp;#95;notation'&gt;Big O notation&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every task in Codility has expectations for performance expressed in Bit O  notation. This is also a hint and a guide how you need to implement the solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's good to write code that generates test data and to use benchmarking to  make sure a solution has good performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's useful to develop a naive or slow solution first (if you can do that  fast), as you can use it to test the fast solution, that often has more  complex implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My solutions to more complex problems are not that readable and the code is  not great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue working on Codility challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also migrated email sending for a side project that I have (&lt;a href='http://servisne.info'&gt;servisne.info&lt;/a&gt;) from Mandrill to Mailgun.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello World

<description>
&lt;p&gt;Today is my first day as an independent consultant. For the last 4 years I worked on &lt;a href='https://semaphoreci.com'&gt;Semaphore&lt;/a&gt;, a continuous integration service used daily by thousands of developers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I decided to join my wife &lt;a href='http://hackberry.co'&gt;Tanja&lt;/a&gt; and to find a niche where we can make a difference. We're still working on that. Until then, I'll work as an independent consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this page as the log of my weekly activities. I'm still not sure if this is a good idea - to make this page public, but I'll still try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
