  <p>I wasn't very productive this week. I did a solid work on client projects, however, I failed to meet any personal goals. I didn't read any papers and I didn't work on personal projects. I had a personal obligation that took a significant chunk of my time, but I still managed to schedule 3 slots to work on personal projects. I failed as I overslept all of them.</p><p>My goal for the next week is not to let this happen again.</p>

  <p> An interesting thing this week is that I started using the  <a href='http://pomodorotechnique.com/'>Pomodoro Technique</a>. It's a well known  time management technique that improves focus and flow.</p><p> I don't really have problems with focusing. However, I do sometimes have  problem with 'unfocusing'. I tend to forget taking a break. When I worked in a  company, my day was filled with different tasks and interruptions so I took a  break between the tasks. However, when I work alone I tend to work on a single  task for a longer period of time. The Pomodoro Technique helps by enforcing  regular breaks.</p><p> During the breaks I do a small chore, stare at the ceiling or gaze at the  seconds hand on my watch. I don't do any mentally involving task and I don't  sit at the computer. So I'm still focused on the main task and I can think away  from the keyboard. With that in mind, I don't feel guilty for taking a break,  since I know that the break is good for me and for a project that I'm  working on.</p><p> The technique works well for me, but I just started. I'll have more insight in  few weeks.</p>

  <p>This was a busy week, but not much happened actually. I'm still busy with client work. Unfortunately, I didn't find time to work on the side project.</p><p>I did schedule some time to read <a href='/papers.html'>Lisp: A Language for Stratified Design</a> by Abelson and Sussman, 2 professors from MIT, famous by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure&#95;and&#95;Interpretation&#95;of&#95;Computer&#95;Programs'>SICP</a>.</p><p>I found a nice Ruby on Rails related resource <a href='https://rorsecurity.info/'>Ruby on Rails Security Project</a>. It includes a number of guides on RoR security and a newsletter that looks like a neat way to keep up with the important topic.</p><p>I added one new tip to <a href='https://github.com/strika/rails-tips'>Rails Tips</a> repository. The plan is to make at least one contribution to the repository every week.</p>
</div>

  <p>This week I completed last formal steps for joining Toptal and I'm now a Toptal member. Still didn't spend much time on the platform, searching for jobs, as I'm busy with client work.</p><p>I read <a href='/papers.html'>Organizing Programs Without Classes</a> which compares class based object oriented languages with those based on prototypes.</p><p>I continued working on a side project - managing book collections for teams, but I still struggle at finding time for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="log-post">
  <h4 class="log-title">May 6, 2016</h4>

  <p>I continued working on the client project that I started the last week. I learned that the project started as a pre-Rails 1.0 application. It's great to work on an application that's been ticking for so long.</p><p>At the start of the week I worked intensively on my Toptal application. Yesterday, I had the last interview and I'm now accepted to Toptal talent pool. I'm still not sure how much work will I do through Toptal, but it's nice to have that as an option.</p><p>This week I read <a href='/papers.html'>Searching for Spaceships</a> by David Eppstein. Although it's not written for the wide programming community, it's very interesting if you're into <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The&#95;Game&#95;of&#95;Life'>Life</a>.</p>

  <p> I focused most of my time on a new client project, that will probably keep me  busy for the next few months. It's an established project that's been around  for around 10 years. It has a small, but dedicated team. So far, I spent most  of my time learning about the domain and the code base, but I also did few  smaller contributions.</p><p> I read Donald Knuth's ACM Turing award lecture from 1974 - Computer Programming  as an Art. Read more about it on the <a href='/papers.html'>list of papers</a>.</p><p> I learned few surprising (to me) but useful tips related to Ruby on Rails and  testing this week. I created <a href='https://github.com/strika/rails-tips'>Rails Tips</a>  repository to collect them. I choose a GitHub repository, as I welcome  contributions. I'm generally looking for tips related to Ruby or Rails or  related tools that are less known, interesting or surprising.</p>

  <p>I worked on a client project and I found another project that will keep my busy for the next few months. If you still want to work with me, please contact me to check my availability. I might still be open for smaller consulting gigs.</p><p>I had another Toptal interview that I passed. And I have one more step left before I can join Toptal.</p><p>This week I choose to read <em>Why Functional Programming Matters</em> by John Hughes. The paper was published in 1984. It discusses advantages of functional programming over "conventional" languages.  In particular, it discusses how higher order functions and lazy evaluation contribute to modularity. I also printed out several papers for the next few weeks.</p><p>I switched to <a href='https://neovim.io/'>Neovim</a> as my main editor instead of Vim. Few fellow developers reported that it's stable enough for daily use. I'll try it out for the next few weeks. I created a new GitHub repository for <a href='https://github.com/strika/neovimfiles'>Neovim configuration</a> and updated my <a href='https://github.com/strika/dotfiles'>dotfiles repository</a> to install Neovim automatically.</p><p>In the next few weeks, I plan to focus on client projects and to wrap up Toptal application.</p>

  <h4 class="log-title">April 15, 2016</h4>

  <p>This week, I concentrated on Toptal application. I continued going through <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>. Although I didn't complete all lessons, I concluded that I did enough to officially apply at Toptal.</p><p>I had my first Toptal screening interview on Thursday. It was a short, pleasant conversation and the Toptal person informed me that I can continue to Codility based test.</p><p>I did Codility test on Friday. I'm still waiting for results.</p><p>I helped <a href='http://hackberry.co'>Tanja</a> complete some old projects. It was a sort of spring cleaning for freelancers.</p><p>I also did some paperwork and learned more about running a business.</p>
</div>

<div class="log-post">
  <h4 class="log-title">April 8, 2016</h4>

  <p>I continued working on the client project. And I did a smaller job to help out <a href='http://hackberry.co'>Tanja</a> with her work.</p><p>I fixed 2 annoying exceptions for <a href='http://servisne.info'>servisne.info</a>, the service I developed and maintain.</p><p>I read The Humble Programmer, the ACM Turing award Lecture by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger&#95;W.&#95;Dijkstra'>Dijkstra</a> from 1972. And it's a fantastic paper! I wrote more about that on <a href='/papers.html'>the papers list</a>.</p><p>I also continued working on <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>. It's interesting that another programmer contacted me though the repository. We exchanged few emails with tips and shared our experience about Codility and programming in general.</p>

  <p>I started working on a client project. However, I still have one slot left. If you need my help, or if you know someone who might, let me know.</p><p>I bought a new laptop - Macbook Pro 13". My initial choice was Dell XPS 13" with Ubuntu. The main problem with Dell + Ubuntu is that some popular software (like Skype) doesn't work great. A friend advised me that this is something potential clients don't want to hear about.</p><p>I'm used to working on 27" iMac and didn't expect much from Macbook Pro. But, it's a really nice machine. It's good looking, faster than iMac and it has a great screen. My only criticism is that the keyboard is not that great. It has that clickety sound, like I have long finger nails. But, it's not a big problem.</p><p>I visited a local meetup that featured 2 talks. The first one was by Sandra Prvulović, an HR expert. It discussed the problem of finding experienced developers for a company. One of the most interesting remarks I heard is that the IT companies have more or less equal offer in Novi Sad. Because of that, not many developers switch companies, although many say that they would if a company makes a good offer.</p><p>The other talk was by <a href='https://medium.com/@tijanamomirov'>Tijana Momirov</a>. She talked about her experience living and working as a digital nomad. It was a very inspiring talk for someone who's just starting his own business.</p><p>I read the paper <a href='https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf'>Some History of Functional Programming Languages</a> by D. A. Turner. It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>LISP</a>, was not influenced by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda&#95;calculus'>lambda calculus</a>. Apparently, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John&#95;McCarthy&#95;%28computer&#95;scientist%29'>John McCarthy</a> didn't study <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo&#95;Church'>Church's</a> papers, before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.</p><p>Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>Haskell</a>.</p><p>My plan is to continue reading one <a href='/papers.html'>paper every week</a>.</p><p>I also continued working on <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>.</p>

  <p>This was my first week as an independent consultant. And it went pretty slow. A project that I planned for this week got postponed, so I concentrated on some preparation work.</p><p>I updated my homepage a little bit. The website needs a full redesign, but for now, my goal was to make it decent. I updated the text on the homepage, added some links to the articles I wrote and the link to the <a href='http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016&#95;stricevic&#95;supercharged&#95;feature&#95;flags/'>conference talk</a> I recently gave at WebCamp.si. I also started writing a short summary of my professional life, to replace the CV.</p><p>Another thing that I set up is this log of my weekly activities.</p><p>I did some research about Toptal as a source of clients. To get into Toptal, you need to pass a interview process, much like a standard company interview. One of the tasks is <a href='https://codility.com/'>Codility</a> test. I tried doing few Codility tests that are <a href='https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/'>freely available</a> and they are harder than I though. So I set up a <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>git repository</a> and started going through the lessons.</p><p>My goal is to complete as many lessons as I can. I learned few things so far:</p><ul><li>Lessons are harder than I thought. I'm not as good as I though.</li><li>I can get better by practicing. Ideas can be applied in different  challenges.</li><li>You need to know what <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big&#95;O&#95;notation'>Big O notation</a> is.</li><li>Every task in Codility has expectations for performance expressed in Bit O  notation. This is also a hint and a guide how you need to implement the solution.</li><li>It's good to write code that generates test data and to use benchmarking to  make sure a solution has good performance.</li><li>It's useful to develop a naive or slow solution first (if you can do that  fast), as you can use it to test the fast solution, that often has more  complex implementation.</li><li>My solutions to more complex problems are not that readable and the code is  not great.</li></ul><p>I plan to continue working on Codility challenges.</p><p>I also migrated email sending for a side project that I have (<a href='http://servisne.info'>servisne.info</a>) from Mandrill to Mailgun.</p>

  <p>Today is my first day as an independent consultant. For the last 4 years I worked on <a href='https://semaphoreci.com'>Semaphore</a>, a continuous integration service used daily by thousands of developers around the world.</p><p>Now, I decided to join my wife <a href='http://hackberry.co'>Tanja</a> and to find a niche where we can make a difference. We're still working on that. Until then, I'll work as an independent consultant.</p><p>I plan to use this page as the log of my weekly activities. I'm still not sure if this is a good idea - to make this page public, but I'll still try it out.</p>
