  <p>I continued working on the client project. And I did a smaller job to help out <a href='http://hackberry.co'>Tanja</a> with her work.</p><p>I fixed 2 annoying exceptions for <a href='http://servisne.info'>servisne.info</a>, the service I developed and maintain.</p><p>I read The Humble Programmer, the ACM Turing award Lecture by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger&#95;W.&#95;Dijkstra'>Dijkstra</a> from 1972. And it's a fantastic paper! I wrote more about that on <a href='/papers.html'>the papers list</a>.</p><p>I also continued working on <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>. It's interesting that another programmer contacted me though the repository. We exchanged few emails with tips and shared our experience about Codility and programming in general.</p>

  <p>I started working on a client project. However, I still have one slot left. If you need my help, or if you know someone who might, let me know.</p><p>I bought a new laptop - Macbook Pro 13". My initial choice was Dell XPS 13" with Ubuntu. The main problem with Dell + Ubuntu is that some popular software (like Skype) doesn't work great. A friend advised me that this is something potential clients don't want to hear about.</p><p>I'm used to working on 27" iMac and didn't expect much from Macbook Pro. But, it's a really nice machine. It's good looking, faster than iMac and it has a great screen. My only criticism is that the keyboard is not that great. It has that clickety sound, like I have long finger nails. But, it's not a big problem.</p><p>I visited a local meetup that featured 2 talks. The first one was by Sandra Prvulović, an HR expert. It discussed the problem of finding experienced developers for a company. One of the most interesting remarks I heard is that the IT companies have more or less equal offer in Novi Sad. Because of that, not many developers switch companies, although many say that they would if a company makes a good offer.</p><p>The other talk was by <a href='https://medium.com/@tijanamomirov'>Tijana Momirov</a>. She talked about her experience living and working as a digital nomad. It was a very inspiring talk for someone who's just starting his own business.</p><p>I read the paper <a href='https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf'>Some History of Functional Programming Languages</a> by D. A. Turner. It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>LISP</a>, was not influenced by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda&#95;calculus'>lambda calculus</a>. Apparently, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John&#95;McCarthy&#95;%28computer&#95;scientist%29'>John McCarthy</a> didn't study <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo&#95;Church'>Church's</a> papers, before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.</p><p>Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell&#95;%28programming&#95;language%29'>Haskell</a>.</p><p>My plan is to continue reading one <a href='/papers.html'>paper every week</a>.</p><p>I also continued working on <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>Codility lessons</a>.</p>

  <p>This was my first week as an independent consultant. And it went pretty slow. A project that I planned for this week got postponed, so I concentrated on some preparation work.</p><p>I updated my homepage a little bit. The website needs a full redesign, but for now, my goal was to make it decent. I updated the text on the homepage, added some links to the articles I wrote and the link to the <a href='http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016&#95;stricevic&#95;supercharged&#95;feature&#95;flags/'>conference talk</a> I recently gave at WebCamp.si. I also started writing a short summary of my professional life, to replace the CV.</p><p>Another thing that I set up is this log of my weekly activities.</p><p>I did some research about Toptal as a source of clients. To get into Toptal, you need to pass a interview process, much like a standard company interview. One of the tasks is <a href='https://codility.com/'>Codility</a> test. I tried doing few Codility tests that are <a href='https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/'>freely available</a> and they are harder than I though. So I set up a <a href='https://github.com/strika/codility'>git repository</a> and started going through the lessons.</p><p>My goal is to complete as many lessons as I can. I learned few things so far:</p><ul><li>Lessons are harder than I thought. I'm not as good as I though.</li><li>I can get better by practicing. Ideas can be applied in different  challenges.</li><li>You need to know what <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big&#95;O&#95;notation'>Big O notation</a> is.</li><li>Every task in Codility has expectations for performance expressed in Bit O  notation. This is also a hint and a guide how you need to implement the solution.</li><li>It's good to write code that generates test data and to use benchmarking to  make sure a solution has good performance.</li><li>It's useful to develop a naive or slow solution first (if you can do that  fast), as you can use it to test the fast solution, that often has more  complex implementation.</li><li>My solutions to more complex problems are not that readable and the code is  not great.</li></ul><p>I plan to continue working on Codility challenges.</p><p>I also migrated email sending for a side project that I have (<a href='http://servisne.info'>servisne.info</a>) from Mandrill to Mailgun.</p>
