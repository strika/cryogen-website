  <h4><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>I got Commodore 64 when I was 10. So I completed masters in software engineering. Started PhD. Quit. Spent few years working on <a href='https://semaphoreci.com'>Semaphore</a>, a continuous integration service used daily by thousands of developers around the world.</p><p>In March 2016, I became an independent consultant.</p><h2><a name="trigger"></a>Trigger</h2><p>It all began when I got <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore&#95;64'>Commodore 64</a> and latter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore&#95;128'>Commodore 128</a>. I was 10 and C64/128 was long discontinued, but that didn't matter to me. It was an amazing machine.</p><p>The machine came with a book called "What can C64 do?", that I still have on my book shelf. It was a guide to the Commodore BASIC programming language. Commodore 128 had a diskette unit so I figured out how I can make programs and save them on a diskette.</p><p>Back then I was at primary school and it was popular to have a notebook with questions. You would pass the notebook to your friends and they would answer the questions. I developed my first program to replace the notebook. It was basically a Q&A wizard and it would save answers on a diskette. No one ever used it.</p><h2><a name="first&#95;mastermind&#95;group"></a>First Mastermind Group</h2><p>I was lucky enough to have 3 friends that lived close by and shared my interest in computers. At each point in time, one of us had a solid computer. Commodore 64/128, i386, i486, machines with Cyrix processors, first Pentiums, AMD Durons... The group had it all.</p><p>We used to go to a local computer club with notebooks and to write down instructions for installing programs, games, cracking... We figured out how to format a disk, reinstall Windows and set up drivers.</p><p>At one point, a friend and I were "summoned" by the primary school principal to fix his computer (that wasn't broken in the first place).</p><p>Together, we learned basic things about computer administration and fixing common problems. Today, 2 of us are software engineers and 2 electrical engineers.</p><h2><a name="high&#95;school"></a>High School</h2><p>Early on I decided I want to "do computers" in my life. That's why I went to the Technical High School for computer technician.</p><p>There, I learned basics about computer hardware and programming - Assembly, Pascal, Delphi and C.</p><p>What's even more important, I was surrounded by people that liked computers. This was an era of custom build computers, overclocking, games and website building.</p><p>I learned some Java on my own. We had a graduation exam and I implemented a program for fitness studio in Java. I was very proud about that. Not long after, I found out that it's not a good idea to implement a program as a single, 2000 lines of code class.</p><p>I completed the High School with an award for the best student in generation.</p><h2><a name="university"></a>University</h2><p>After High School, in 2005, I continued my education at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. I got my bachelors degree in computer science in 2009, with a average grade 9.52/10.00 and my masters in software engineering in 2010 with an average grade 10.00/10.00.</p><h2><a name="phd"></a>PhD</h2><p>At end of my masters studies, I was approached by the university staff and invited to stay at the university as a teaching assistant and a PhD student.</p><p>I enjoyed teaching and working with students. I was an assistant on several software engineering related courses (basics of software engineering, patters, modeling).</p><p>On the other hand, my PhD studies didn't go so well. It was hard for me to find a topic that I'm interested in. I liked biology inspired computer systems, artificial life and intelligence, but I was working in the software engineering domain. Also, I wanted to develop a real world systems, but I found out that the academia values papers more than code.</p><p>Since I was unhappy about my slow personal development, after year and a half I quit my PhD studies and the position at the university.</p><h2><a name="rendered&#95;text"></a>Rendered Text</h2><p>...</p>
