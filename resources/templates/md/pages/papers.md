#### Some History of Functional Programming Languages by D. A. Turner.

It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow
in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29), was not
influenced by [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).
Apparently, [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29)
didn't study [Church's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) papers,
before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.

Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29).
