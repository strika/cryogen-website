#### Searching for Spaceships by David Eppstein

This paper is different than others on the list. While most other papers would be
interesting to any programmer, this one is reserved for
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life) enthusiasts. It
explains the rich Life vocabulary and presents different species of Life. Then it
compares different techniques for searching for spaceships and presents a new
technique developed by the author.

If you are into Life and dream about finding spaceships and implementing your
own search program, this is a great paper for you. It's dense, so I have to read
it few more times. The paper was published in 2000, so I assume that finding the
list of papers that cite *Searching for Spaceships* will produce an interesting
reading material.

#### Computer Programming as an Art by Donald E. Knuth

Computer Programming as an Art is the ACM Turing Award Lecture by
[Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) from 1974. Knuth is
famous by his multi-volume work
[The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming),
sometimes abbreviated as TAOCP.

In his lecture, Knuth explains why he chose to call programming an art. He's not
calling the whole programming "universe" an art. Instead, he explains that some
parts of programming profession are an art, while some are science or a craft.

I remember that few years ago blog posts and conference talks about programming
as art/craft/engineering/science were appearing everywhere. Knuth's lecture is
the earliest and probably the most important discussion on the topic as it
inspired many others.

This is another paper I expect to keep returning over the years.

#### Why Functional Programming Matters by John Hughes

The paper was originally published in 1984. It discusses advantages of
functional programming over "conventional" languages. In particular, it
discusses how higher order functions and lazy evaluation contribute to
modularity.

I found useful that the paper clearly expresses how 2 major ideas from
functional programming contribute to the overall functional programming style.

#### The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra

The Humble Programmer is the ACM Turing award Lecture by
[Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) from 1972. And it's
a fantastic paper!

Dijkstra entered the programming profession in 1952. He talks about his
experience as the first Dutch programmer and one of the pioneers of the
discipline. He also speaks about problems and misconceptions that come from that
period and some major milestones for the programming profession (like
[EDSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_delay_storage_automatic_calculator),
[FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran),
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) and
[ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60)).

There are few popular quotes that come from the lecture. Just one of them is:

> If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not
waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with.

And perhaps my favorite:

> The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.

The paper if full of gems like these. I expect to keep returning to the paper
for years.

#### Some History of Functional Programming Languages by D. A. Turner.

It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow
in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29), was not
influenced by [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).
Apparently, [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29)
didn't study [Church's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) papers,
before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.

Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29).
