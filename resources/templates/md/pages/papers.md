#### The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra

The Humble Programmer is the ACM Turing award Lecture by
[Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) from 1972. And it's
a fantastic paper!

Dijkstra entered the programming profession in 1952. He talks about his
experience as the first Dutch programmer and one of the pioneers of the
discipline. He also speaks about problems and misconceptions that come from that
period and some major milestones for the programming profession (like
[EDSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_delay_storage_automatic_calculator),
[FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran),
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) and
[ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60)).

There are few popular quotes that come from the lecture. Just one of them is:

> If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not
waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with.

And perhaps my favorite:

> The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.

The paper if full of gems like these. I expect to keep returning to the paper
for years.

#### Some History of Functional Programming Languages by D. A. Turner.

It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow
in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29), was not
influenced by [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).
Apparently, [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29)
didn't study [Church's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) papers,
before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.

Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29).
