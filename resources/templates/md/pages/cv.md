## Employment

**March 2016 - present, Independent consultant**

I concentrate on Ruby on Rails stack and JavaScript.

**February 2012 - March 2016, Lead engineer at Rendered Text, Novi Sad**

When I joined, Rendered Text was a Ruby on Rails oriented consultancy. I worked
on several client projects. I quickly learned how to find my way around in a few
years old code base.

At the time, part of the team worked actively on
[Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com). Few months after I joined the company,
Semaphore was officially launched. After a while, the whole team switched to
Semaphore and Rendered Text became a product focused company.

I had an opportunity to work on almost all parts of Semaphore's code. I worked
on core parts, such as the subsystem that creates and schedules builds and
deploys, the logging and metrics infrastructure, the user permissions layer and
the system for managing
[features](http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016_stricevic_supercharged_feature_flags/).
I also worked on the user facing application and implemented new major features
such as organization support and Test Boosters.

As Rendered Text and Semaphore grew from 4 full time engineers to 18 engineers,
designers, writers and other makers, I took the role of a lead engineer. I
supported and guided a team of 4 other engineers, held 1 on 1 meetings and
helped new team members get up to speed with our code base.

I also wrote several articles for [Semaphore Community](https://semaphoreci.com/community/authors/strika)
and talked about our experience developing Semaphore on a
[conference](http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016_stricevic_supercharged_feature_flags/).

**October 2010 - February 2012, Teaching Assistant at Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad**

I enjoyed teaching and working with students. I was an assistant on several
software engineering related courses (basics of software engineering, patters,
modeling) for students on third and fourth year of Bachelor studies.
