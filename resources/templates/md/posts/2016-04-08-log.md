I continued working on the client project. And I did a smaller job to help out
[Tanja](http://hackberry.co) with her work.

I fixed 2 annoying exceptions for [servisne.info](http://servisne.info), the
service I developed and maintain.

I read The Humble Programmer, the ACM Turing award Lecture by
[Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) from 1972. And it's
a fantastic paper! I wrote more about that on [the papers list](/papers.html).

I also continued working on [Codility lessons](https://github.com/strika/codility). It's interesting that another programmer contacted me though the repository. We exchanged few emails with tips and shared our experience about Codility and programming in general.
