This was a busy week, but not much happened actually. I'm still busy with client
work. Unfortunately, I didn't find time to work on the side project.

I did schedule some time to read [Lisp: A Language for Stratified Design](/papers.html)
by Abelson and Sussman, 2 professors from MIT, famous by
[SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

I found a nice Ruby on Rails related resource
[Ruby on Rails Security Project](https://rorsecurity.info/). It includes a
number of guides on RoR security and a newsletter that looks like a neat way to
keep up with the important topic.

I added one new tip to [Rails Tips](https://github.com/strika/rails-tips)
repository. The plan is to make at least one contribution to the repository
every week.
