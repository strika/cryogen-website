I work remotely, so I spent part of the week in my home town,
[Sombor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombor) working "even more remotely". I
enjoy changing locations from time to time (although, I'm far from a digital
nomad).

I read [The Imitation Game](/papers.html) by Alan Turing this week. It's the
paper that presents famous Turing test. Although I have knew about Turing test
before, this paper makes things much more clear. If you are interested in AI
field, read this paper. It's an easy to read paper from the father of the field.

I recently saw the movie - [The Imitation Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/).
My memory about the movie is not perfect, but I can't tell that I understand why
the movie is called the way it is. It certainly is about Turing. However, the
movie is about Turing's efforts in WWII and cracking the Enigma code. I don't
remember that it had anything to do with his work in the AI field. Perhaps it's
just a cool title.

I picked up a new, custom made, standing desk this week. I'll put some pictures
next week.
