I worked on a client project and I found another project that will keep my busy
for the next few months. If you still want to work with me, please contact me to
check my availability. I might still be open for smaller consulting gigs.

I had another Toptal interview that I passed. And I have one more step left
before I can join Toptal.

This week I choose to read *Why Functional Programming Matters* by John Hughes.
The paper was published in 1984. It discusses advantages of functional
programming over "conventional" languages.  In particular, it discusses how
higher order functions and lazy evaluation contribute to modularity. I also
printed out several papers for the next few weeks.

I switched to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main editor instead of Vim.
Few fellow developers reported that it's stable enough for daily use. I'll
try it out for the next few weeks. I created a new GitHub repository for [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/strika/neovimfiles) and updated my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/strika/dotfiles) to install Neovim automatically.

In the next few weeks, I plan to focus on client projects and to wrap up Toptal
application.
