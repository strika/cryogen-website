{:title "Log"

This week I met some ex-coworkers. They told me they read this blog from time to
time. While I appreciate that, I have to say that this blog is not really meant
for reading. I don't think that a visitor can pick up a lot of useful stuff from
reading it or that she can find amusement. However, I still think that it's
important for me to keep writing regularly.

There are several reasons for that. My goal is to practice skills that I'm not
good at but are very important for any software developer. One of those skills
is writing. I'm not a native English speaker and I started writing somewhat
recently, so every line of text that I write is important to improve my skills.

Not all writing is equal. I wrote several tutorials for
[Semaphore Community](http://semaphoreci.com/community/authors/strika) that were
well received. It's much better to write a piece that's useful for other
developers than to write for myself. That is something that I need to work on
more in future. However, since I do publish this web log, I still need to keep
it at least decent, which is better than keeping it only for myself.

I think that moving to a more useful content from something that's not that
useful is much easier than to do that from scratch. Time will tell if this is
something that works for me.

Another thing that I'm practicing is keeping promises and staying on schedule. I
want to publish few sentences every Friday. Sometimes it's not easy to find 15
minutes to do so, which makes keeping the promise even more important.

So, for now, I write this blog to improve my skills, but I hope I'll provide
more value to visitors in future.
