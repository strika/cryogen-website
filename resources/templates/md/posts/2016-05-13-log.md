This week I completed last formal steps for joining Toptal and I'm now a Toptal
member. Still didn't spend much time on the platform, searching for jobs, as I'm
busy with client work.

I read [Organizing Programs Without Classes](/papers.html) which compares class
based object oriented languages with those based on prototypes.

I continued working on a side project - managing book collections for teams, but
I still struggle at finding time for it.
