{:title "Log"
 :layout :post}

Last week I wrote about keeping promises and this week I broke one. This was the
first Friday since I started writing the log that I didn't write one. I'm 2 days
late. No excuses really.

I have an ongoing client work, but I also focused on completing some projects
where development slowed down a little bit. I hope to finish those in the next
few weeks so I can work more on private projects.

I read a paper called Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages. It was a
nice [brain exercise](/papers.html).
