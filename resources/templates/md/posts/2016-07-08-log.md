I changed my reading schedule this week. Instead of reading after I complete all
client work and "when I have time", I read at least half an hour in the morning.
One concern that I had is that this might impact other work. However, this had
no impact on client work. So for now, I'm sticking to "do stuff you want first
and stuff you must next".

I read [Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store](/papers.html) this
week. An interesting paper about scaling problems and Dynamo - a database that
allows developers to trade consistency to achieve high availability and
performance.
