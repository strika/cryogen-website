 I focused most of my time on a new client project, that will probably keep me
 busy for the next few months. It's an established project that's been around
 for around 10 years. It has a small, but dedicated team. So far, I spent most
 of my time learning about the domain and the code base, but I also did few
 smaller contributions.

 I read Donald Knuth's ACM Turing award lecture from 1974 - Computer Programming
 as an Art. Read more about it on the [list of papers](/papers.html).

 I learned few surprising (to me) but useful tips related to Ruby on Rails and
 testing this week. I created [Rails Tips](https://github.com/strika/rails-tips)
 repository to collect them. I choose a GitHub repository, as I welcome
 contributions. I'm generally looking for tips related to Ruby or Rails or
 related tools that are less known, interesting or surprising.
