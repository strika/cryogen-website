I started working on a client project. However, I still have one slot left. If
you need my help, or if you know someone who might, let me know.

I bought a new laptop - Macbook Pro 13". My initial choice was Dell XPS 13" with
Ubuntu. The main problem with Dell + Ubuntu is that some popular software (like
Skype) doesn't work great. A friend advised me that this is something potential
clients don't want to hear about.

I'm used to working on 27" iMac and didn't expect much from Macbook Pro. But,
it's a really nice machine. It's good looking, faster than iMac and it has a
great screen. My only criticism is that the keyboard is not that great. It has
that clickety sound, like I have long finger nails. But, it's not a big problem.

I visited a local meetup that featured 2 talks. The first one was by Sandra
PrvuloviÄ‡, an HR expert. It discussed the problem of finding experienced
developers for a company. One of the most interesting remarks I heard is that
the IT companies have more or less equal offer in Novi Sad. Because of that, not
many developers switch companies, although many say that they would if a company
makes a good offer.

The other talk was by [Tijana Momirov](https://medium.com/@tijanamomirov). She
talked about her experience living and working as a digital nomad. It was a very
inspiring talk for someone who's just starting his own business.

I read the paper [Some History of Functional Programming Languages](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf)
by D. A. Turner. It was generally an interesting paper, although hard to follow
in some parts. I did learn some interesting facts, though. For example, that
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29), was not
influenced by [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).
Apparently, [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29)
didn't study [Church's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) papers,
before he invented LISP. Modern lisps, however, are based on lambda calculus.

Another interesting part is a discussion about languages that influenced
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29).

My plan is to continue reading one paper every week.

I also continued working on [Codility lessons](https://github.com/strika/codility).
