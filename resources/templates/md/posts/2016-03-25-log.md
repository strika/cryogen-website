This was my first week as an independent consultant. And it went pretty slow. A
project that I planned for this week got postponed, so I concentrated on some
preparation work.

I updated my homepage a little bit. The website needs a full redesign, but for
now, my goal was to make it decent. I updated the text on the homepage, added
some links to the articles I wrote and the link to the [conference talk](http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016_stricevic_supercharged_feature_flags/)
I recently gave at WebCamp.si. I also started writing a short summary of my
professional life, to replace the CV.

Another thing that I set up is this log of my weekly activities.

I did some research about Toptal as a source of clients. To get into Toptal, you
need to pass a interview process, much like a standard company interview. One of
the tasks is [Codility](https://codility.com/) test. I tried doing few Codility
tests that are [freely available](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/) and
they are harder than I though. So I set up a [git repository](https://github.com/strika/codility)
and started going through the lessons.

My goal is to complete as many lessons as I can. I learned few things so far:

- Lessons are harder than I thought. I'm not as good as I though.
- I can get better by practicing. Ideas can be applied in different
  challenges.
- You need to know what [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is.
- Every task in Codility has expectations for performance expressed in Bit O
  notation. This is also a hint and a guide how you need to implement the solution.
- It's good to write code that generates test data and to use benchmarking to
  make sure a solution has good performance.
- It's useful to develop a naive or slow solution first (if you can do that
  fast), as you can use it to test the fast solution, that often has more
  complex implementation.
- My solutions to more complex problems are not that readable and the code is
  not great.

I plan to continue working on Codility challenges.

I also migrated email sending for a side project that I have
([servisne.info](http://servisne.info)) from Mandrill to Mailgun.
