This week, I concentrated on Toptal application. I continued going through
[Codility lessons](https://github.com/strika/codility). Although I didn't
complete all lessons, I concluded that I did enough to officially apply at
Toptal.

I had my first Toptal screening interview on Thursday. It was a short, pleasant
conversation and the Toptal person informed me that I can continue to Codility
based test.

I did Codility test on Friday. I'm still waiting for results.

I helped [Tanja](http://hackberry.co) complete some old projects. It was a sort
of spring cleaning for freelancers.

I also did some paperwork and learned more about running a business.
