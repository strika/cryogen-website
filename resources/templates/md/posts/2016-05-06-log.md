{:title "Log"

I continued working on the client project that I started the last week. I
learned that the project started as a pre-Rails 1.0 application. It's great to
work on an application that's been ticking for so long.

At the start of the week I worked intensively on my Toptal application.
Yesterday, I had the last interview and I'm now accepted to Toptal talent pool.
I'm still not sure how much work will I do through Toptal, but it's nice to have
that as an option.

This week I read [Searching for Spaceships](/papers.html) by David Eppstein.
Although it's not written for the wide programming community, it's very
interesting if you're into
[Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life).
