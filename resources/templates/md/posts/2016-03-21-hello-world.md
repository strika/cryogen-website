{:title "Hello World"

Today is my first day as an independent consultant. For the last 4 years I
worked on [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com), a continuous integration service
used daily by thousands of developers around the world.

Now, I decided to join my wife [Tanja](http://hackberry.co) and to find a niche
where we can make a difference. We're still working on that. Until then, I'll
work as an independent consultant.

I plan to use this page as the log of my weekly activities. I'm still not sure if
this is a good idea - to make this page public, but I'll still try it out.
