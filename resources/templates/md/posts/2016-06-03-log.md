I wasn't very productive this week. I did a solid work on client projects,
however, I failed to meet any personal goals. I didn't read any papers and I
didn't work on personal projects. I had a personal obligation that took a
significant chunk of my time, but I still managed to schedule 3 slots to work on
personal projects. I failed as I overslept all of them.

My goal for the next week is not to let this happen again.
