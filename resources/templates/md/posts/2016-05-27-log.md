 An interesting thing this week is that I started using the
 [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). It's a well known
 time management technique that improves focus and flow.

 I don't really have problems with focusing. However, I do sometimes have
 problem with 'unfocusing'. I tend to forget taking a break. When I worked in a
 company, my day was filled with different tasks and interruptions so I took a
 break between the tasks. However, when I work alone I tend to work on a single
 task for a longer period of time. The Pomodoro Technique helps by enforcing
 regular breaks.

 During the breaks I do a small chore, stare at the ceiling or gaze at the
 seconds hand on my watch. I don't do any mentally involving task and I don't
 sit at the computer. So I'm still focused on the main task and I can think away
 from the keyboard. With that in mind, I don't feel guilty for taking a break,
 since I know that the break is good for me and for a project that I'm
 working on.

 The technique works well for me, but I just started. I'll have more insight in
 few weeks.
