The biggest change this week is that I got a new
[standing desk](http://imgur.com/a/71603). I've used a standing desk for a
couple of years now. This desk was custom made by my cousin. We designed a desk
over a family dinner. Since we have a small apartment it was designed
specifically to save space and to match my height. I'm pretty happy so far,
although I already have a version 2.0 in mind.

Couple of weeks ago, a paper named [Deep API Learning](/papers.html)
was features on Hacker News, so I choose it for this week reading exercise.

I also updated
[Rails Tips](https://github.com/strika/rails-tips#how-to-wait-for-a-javascript-library-to-load-in-selenium-tests) with a trick that will make your Selenium
tests more robust.
